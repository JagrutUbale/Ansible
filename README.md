# Ansible

In this project I have created a couple of Ansible Playbooks to configure a webserver using Nginx

Some other Ansible standalone projects I have worked on: 
* 
* [Ansible-iTrust](https://github.com/VivekBhat/Ansible-iTrust): iTrust is a java application used in the undergrad software engineering system. It uses tomcat, mysql, java, and maven. It has a rich set of unit tests.
