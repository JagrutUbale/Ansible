# Ansible

In this project I have created a couple of Ansible Playbooks to configure a webserver using Nginx

## Some other Ansible standalone projects I have worked on: 

* Setup up configuration management and build environments for two software projects.

### checkbox.io

* [Ansible-CheckBox.io](https://github.com/VivekBhat/Ansible-CheckBox.io): Create an ansible script that can prepare a system to run checkbox.io. Verify the system works.

##### Dependencies

* nginx
* node
* monogodb

### iTrust
* [Ansible-iTrust](https://github.com/VivekBhat/Ansible-iTrust): iTrust is a java application used in the undergrad software engineering system. It uses tomcat, mysql, java, and maven. It has a rich set of unit tests.
